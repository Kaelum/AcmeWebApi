// Company, Product, Copyright, Trademark, Version, FileVersion, and InformationalVersion
// are replaced by the automated build process.  The automated build process will keep track of all
// major and minor numbers in use by AssemblyVersion (below).  For each new major.minor version that
// has not previously been seen by the build system, a new build number (3rd number) will be stored
// in the build system, with a starting value of 1 and incremented with each successive build.  The
// revision number (4th number) is not currently in use, but may be used in the future.  It will not
// have any affect on the build number.  The AssemblyInformationalVersion value is SemVer 2.0.0
// compliant (see https://semver.org/), and will follow the SemVer formatting rules.
